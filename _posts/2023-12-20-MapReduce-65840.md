Thank you for accessing my study path.

It's just my study records of MIT 65840, a famous distributed system coures. I would **NOT** share any code due to the student code and policy, just share my thinking and the possible solution I found. The accuracy of my solution is not guaranteed. Hope you would enjoy my share.

## 1. Overview of this task

As the first lab of MIT 65840, MapReduce implementation task is a concise and understandable task. All I did is just watching first several courese, reading the Lab page and MapReduce paper.

For those guys who have little coding experience or basic C/JAVA/PYTHON experience. Go courses are highly recommended. For those learner who can read or understand Chinese, a serious video from [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1HW4y1n7BF) and official [Go tutorial](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/) is recommend. I have ZERO go experience before learning this course. However, I can still finish this Lab after reading those materials.

For those who really CAN NOT find **any possible solutions**, just like me, this [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1mF411J7tH/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=30a004cc68fcb997cec4043e4e5862c7) published by 郭郭wg, an niubi bilibili up, may save your time and life. It could help you better understanding what is RPC and MapReduce. I learned a lot from those courese. Neither did he shared his code. 

## 2. Other Hint for this Lab 

The *A few rules* and *Hints* parts are essential for finishing this part. Those instructions could help you anytime you meet obstacles. 

The ExampleCall is a useful tool to help understanding data transmission between Coordinator and worker.

## 3. Before Starting Programming

Just make sure you read [Map-Reduce paper](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf).

## 4. The Structure I used

Since the lab provides a detailed structure, all tasks I need to do is to build a RPC task and a reasonable Coordinator.

The coordinator contains 2 channel. One for Map task and another for Reduce. Besides, a map named TaskConditionMap which records process of all tasks are needed.

## 5. Dummy Solution for Time Checker

*All those dummy solutions I provided, as it mentioned, are silly (but work!). I am 1000% for sure others would find better solutions. But that is all I got and used.*

To implement backup tasks and make sure those backup plan could only be scheduled after some relatively long period of time. Timestamps are desginated to all generated tasks. I compared all timestamp with year 2000 to find out those un-working tasks, since its 2023 right now. Only those works which owns a timestamp larger than 2000 would be considered working or worked. 

## 6. Dummy Solution for Finish Signal

Another problem I met is to told coordinator a task is finished successful. One solution I adopted is using another `Call` method.

I wrote 2 Call funtion in this task. The first one, named Process, is responsible for getting data asking task from coordinator. The other one, named TaskDone, would notify Coordinator the task is finished without thinking about time limit.

**It is coordinator's job to determine whether the work is useful or not.**

## 8. Doodle

It is definetly a simple but not that simple task for me. I am glad I finish the Lab1 and have a deeper understanding of MapReduce. Right now I am struggling building Raft ＞﹏＜. Hoping sharing my own precious solutions for Lab2 and earn more soon.
